Code samples 

Hello and welcome! 
If you're looking at this, I imagine you are interested in working with me as a developer. Many of these code samples are not exactly cutting edge tech anymore, 
but this repo serves as a nice snapshot of my evolution as a developer. 

To get an accurate idea of what I can help you with in the present moment, I suggest starting with whichever folder has the most recent commit. 

Thanks for looking and your interest!
