After Cargrove, I did a variety of work for an agency based in Maine. Mostly, it was theme development for Shopify, BigCommerce and Wordpress. Some of the fun bits were writing some old-school javascript 'plugins' for Shopify sites. I've included a timer script here as an example. 

However, I did start down the road of setting up a static site for them as well. It was my first chance to play with Apollo configurations. I was able to pull data from BigCommerce's GraphQL API and 'mesh' it with CMS data from GraphCMS. I went this route because, at least at this moment, Gatsby's source plugin for BigCommerce is not actively maintained. In the process of this, I got a thorough introduction to querying data via GraphQL, which I had only played a little with before.

As a note to anyone reading, React Static is a wonderfully simple static site generator. Being a fan of React, I would happily use React Static in the future, as opposed to 11ty - though that is also a terrific static generator.
